                  Go Quality Networksolution's services are not directed to individuals under
                  the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold as required by
                  applicable local law). We do not knowingly collect personal
                  information from children under this age. If we become aware
                  that we have inadvertently collected personal information from
                  a child under the relevant age without verifiable parental
                  consent, we will take steps to delete such information from
                  our records promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and
                  believe that your child has provided us with personal
                  information without your consent, please contact us using the
                  details in Section 10.
